description: |
  This app will launch a demo server in a Singularity container (virtual machine) on a Rosie computer node.
  
  The interface can either be interacted with directly, or the API can be accessed via internal nodes on Rosie using account 
  credentials to connect remotely.
  
  Only one T4 GPU will be requested by default.
